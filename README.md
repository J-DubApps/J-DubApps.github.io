Julianwest.me landing-page design is sourced from Scott Kyle & Appden (https://github.com/appden/appden.github.com).

Over time all Julianwest.me static content will be migrated to Jekyll.  Read more about Jeckyll here: https://jekyllrb.com

Jekyll is an elegant "CMS" that focuses on text and static pages rather than using a database and dynamic pages.  It's maintained by the GitHub team and well-worth a look.

Blogger, Squarespace, and Ghost

I used these platforms during the lifespan of julianwest.me and the now-defunct mydigitalpathos.com, and I loved many things about each platofrm.  I think those solutions were great, especially for non-programmers, and overall much better for that audience than Wordpress or Movabletype, though way less flexible. Managing templates is annoying, and the more I have delved back into programming the past 5 years the more annoying it becomes.  So I have migrated my main site to GitHub Pages / Jekyll, and my blog to Medium (blog.julianwest.me).  A bit less to maintain, design-wise, and more opportunity to just write or code without living in JavaScript-based templates and frequent CSS document tweaking.
